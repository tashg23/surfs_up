# surfs_up

## project_overview: 
To examine historical weather trends in Oahu (namely temperature and precipitation levels) to determine if opening a surf shop in this location is sustainable year round. 

## database: 
sqlite:///hawaii.sqlite

## results: 
- Using 1711 weather observations, the average temperature in July is 76 F with a low of 61 F and a high of 87 F.

- The average temperature in December is 71 F with a low of 56 F and a high of 83 F.

While the temperatures in December can be slightly lower compared to July, it seems that whether it is summer or winter, the temperatures do not drop sufficiently where people would be unable to surf.  

## summary: 
Based on the temperature analysis, it seems that there is no risk to the investment (i.e. the temperature is sufficiently high year round to start a surf shop in Oahu).
